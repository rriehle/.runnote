## Implementation Plan

[Import from planning phase]

## Progress Tracker

### Current Work

- [ ] Task 1 [0%]----[50%]----[100%]
- [ ] Task 2 [0%]----[50%]----[100%]

## Architecture Checkpoint

### ADR Assessment (if ADR integration enabled)

**ADR Validation Commands**:

```bash
# Verify no conflicts with existing decisions
adr-search tag :architecture
adr-search content "[implementation topic]"

# Check ADR validation
adr-validate
```

Before implementing:

- [ ] Searched for related ADRs to avoid conflicts
- [ ] Is this an architecturally significant decision? â†’ Create ADR
- [ ] Does this change an existing architectural decision? â†’ Update/supersede ADR
- [ ] Will this affect multiple components or modules? â†’ Document in ADR

**ADR Creation Queue**: [List ADRs identified in planning that need creation]

- [ ] Create ADR for [Decision Title] with tags [:tag1, :tag2]

### Documentation Impact Assessment

Before implementing:

- [ ] Will this change affect module interfaces? â†’ Update documentation
- [ ] Does this introduce new data flows? â†’ Update diagrams
- [ ] Are there new architectural patterns? â†’ Document in implementation section
- [ ] Will this impact system performance? â†’ Update performance characteristics
- [ ] Creating new modules/packages? â†’ Add documentation immediately

After implementing:

- [ ] Created/updated relevant ADRs (if applicable)
- [ ] Updated affected documentation with new diagrams
- [ ] Verified all diagrams still render correctly
- [ ] Updated architecture views if system boundaries changed
- [ ] Added documentation to all new modules

## Test Strategy & Test Design

### Test Approach Selection

Choose your testing approach based on implementation scope:

**Unit Tests**:
- [ ] Standard unit tests for individual functions/classes
- [ ] Property-based tests for complex logic
- [ ] Commands: [Project-specific test commands]

**Integration Tests**:
- [ ] Cross-module integration tests
- [ ] End-to-end workflows
- [ ] External system integration

**Test-Driven Development (TDD) Workflow**:

1. **Red** - Write failing test that captures desired behavior
2. **Green** - Write minimal code to pass the test
3. **Refactor** - Improve code while keeping tests green
4. **Repeat** - Continue in small increments

### Test Implementation Checklist

**Before coding**:
- [ ] Identified appropriate test location/framework
- [ ] Written failing tests that define expected behavior
- [ ] Validated test commands work

**During implementation**:
- [ ] Running tests frequently (ideally after each small change)
- [ ] Tests guide implementation decisions
- [ ] Refactoring with green tests for safety

**Property Testing** (for complex business logic):
- [ ] Consider property tests for data transformations
- [ ] Use when testing invariants across large input spaces
