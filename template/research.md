## Research Questions

What we need to understand:

1. [Primary question that drives this research]
2. [Secondary questions that support understanding]
3. [Edge cases or constraints to investigate]

## Investigation Approach

- [ ] Codebase analysis: [What to examine]
- [ ] External research: [What to look up]
- [ ] **ADR Review** (if ADR integration enabled): Search existing architectural decisions
  - [ ] Search by topic: `adr-search content "[topic keywords]"`
  - [ ] Search by tag: `adr-search tag :[relevant-tag]`
  - [ ] List all ADRs: `adr-search list`
- [ ] Experiments needed: [What to test]
- [ ] Stakeholders to consult: [Who might have insights]

## Findings Log

### [HH:MM] - Initial Discovery

[Real-time findings as you investigate]

### [HH:MM] - Deep Dive into [Component]

[Detailed analysis with code snippets]

## Emerging Patterns

[Patterns, problems, or opportunities discovered]

## Constraints Identified

- **Technical**: [Hard limitations]
- **Business**: [Policy or requirement constraints]
- **Resource**: [Time, budget, or personnel limits]

## Open Questions

Questions that need answers before planning can begin:

- [ ] [Question] - Owner: [@teammate]
- [ ] [Question] - Needs: [Research/Experiment/Decision]

## Phase Transition Checklist

Ready for Planning Phase when:

- [ ] All critical questions answered
- [ ] Constraints fully understood
- [ ] At least 2 viable approaches identified
- [ ] Risks catalogued
- [ ] ADR review completed (if applicable)

**Next Phase**: Planning (Estimated: [Date/Time])
