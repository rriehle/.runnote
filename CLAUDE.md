## Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Knowledge Extraction Journey** | Development work extracts learning value; capture context in real-time |
| **Real-Time Documentation** | Write during work, not after; captures actual sequence, failures, and decisions |
| **Failure as First-Class** | Failed attempts are negative knowledge preventing future repetition |
| **Four-Phase Discipline** | Research → Planning → Implementation → Review with transition criteria |
| **Institutional Knowledge** | Sessions accumulate into organizational memory enabling pattern recognition |
| **ADR Integration** | Planning RunNotes identify decision candidates; ADRs formalize them |

## Workflow Quick Reference

### Starting a New Session

**Pre-flight checks:**
1. Search related sessions: `runnote-search content "topic"`, `runnote-search tag :tag`
2. Search ADRs: `adr-search content "topic"`
3. Choose appropriate phase

**Launch:**
```bash
runnote-launch <phase> <topic> --tags tag1,tag2 --thinking-mode "think harder"
```

**Initialize:**
1. Review template sections
2. Fill metadata (tags, status)
3. Import context (link related RunNotes, ADRs)
4. Set objectives
5. Begin logging with timestamp

**Detailed workflow:** [doc/README-WORKFLOWS.md#starting-a-new-session](doc/README-WORKFLOWS.md#starting-a-new-session)

### Phase Transitions

**Research → Planning:**
- ✅ Questions answered, findings documented, risks identified
- Launch planning session, import research context
- **Details:** [doc/README-WORKFLOWS.md#research--planning-transition](doc/README-WORKFLOWS.md#research--planning-transition)

**Planning → Implementation:**
- ✅ Approach selected, plan with estimates, success criteria defined
- Create required ADRs, launch implementation session
- **Details:** [doc/README-WORKFLOWS.md#planning--implementation-transition](doc/README-WORKFLOWS.md#planning--implementation-transition)

**Implementation → Review:**
- ✅ Phases complete (or deferred), tests passing, code committed
- Launch review, calculate metrics, conduct DAKI
- **Details:** [doc/README-WORKFLOWS.md#implementation--review-transition](doc/README-WORKFLOWS.md#implementation--review-transition)

### Active Session Management

**Update frequency:**
- Every 30-60 minutes during focused work
- Immediately when hitting blockers
- After completing each planned phase
- Before context switches or breaks

**Example update:**
```markdown
### [HH:MM] - Activity Description
State: 🟢 Active
**Objective**: What attempting
**Approach**: How attempting it
**Result**: What happened
**Time**: X minutes
**Next**: Concrete next step
Progress: [=====>    ] 50%
```

**Detailed guidelines:** [doc/README-WORKFLOWS.md#active-session-management](doc/README-WORKFLOWS.md#active-session-management)

## Integration Quick Reference

### With ADR Tools

**Identify ADR candidates** during research/planning:
- Affects multiple components
- Expensive to reverse
- Establishes pattern
- Technology adoption

**Link bidirectionally:**
```edn
# In RunNotes metadata
{:related-documents {:adr #{"ADR-00042"}}}

# In ADR metadata
{:runnotes #{"RunNotes-2025-10-14-Topic-planning"}}
```

**Details:** [doc/README-INTEGRATION.md#integration-with-adr-tools](doc/README-INTEGRATION.md#integration-with-adr-tools)

### With Requirements Tools

**Extract from planning RunNotes:**
```yaml
# In planning RunNotes
objectives:
  - Enable customer service to process refunds

# Becomes requirements
REQ-REFUND-001: System MUST calculate refund amount
```

**Link implementation to requirements:**
```markdown
### [HH:MM] - Implementing Refund Calculation
Implements: REQ-REFUND-001
```

**Details:** [doc/README-INTEGRATION.md#integration-with-requirements-tools](doc/README-INTEGRATION.md#integration-with-requirements-tools)

### With Code and Tests

**Link code to RunNotes:**
```python
# See: RunNotes-2025-10-14-Feature-implementation
# Architecture: ADR-00042
```

**In RunNotes metadata:**
```edn
{:related-documents
 {:code-files #{"src/module/file.py:45-67"}
  :test-files #{"test/module/test_file.py:12"}}}
```

**Details:** [doc/README-INTEGRATION.md#integration-with-code-and-tests](doc/README-INTEGRATION.md#integration-with-code-and-tests)

## Quality Standards Quick Reference

### Documentation Quality

| Standard | Correct | Incorrect |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Timestamps** | `14:30 - Activity` | `2:30pm - Activity` |
| **State** | `State: 🟢 Active` | `State: Active` |
| **Code** | ` ```python ` | ` ``` ` (no language) |
| **Metrics** | `45 minutes`, `70% improvement` | `A while`, `Much faster` |
| **References** | `src/auth.py:45-67` | `auth file` |

**Details:** [doc/README-QUALITY.md#documentation-quality-standards](doc/README-QUALITY.md#documentation-quality-standards)

### Failure Documentation

**Always document:**
1. **Hypothesis** - What you thought would work (with reasoning)
2. **Time** - Quantified investment (30min research, 2h implementation, etc.)
3. **Failure Mode** - Exactly how it failed (with evidence)
4. **Root Cause** - Why it failed (analysis)
5. **Prevention** - How to avoid in future
6. **Salvageable** - What can be reused (nothing is 100% waste)

**Details:** [doc/README-QUALITY.md#failure-documentation-standards](doc/README-QUALITY.md#failure-documentation-standards)

### Common Pitfalls

❌ **Avoid:**
- Skipping phases (especially planning)
- Retroactive documentation (losing context)
- Vague descriptions ("made progress")
- Missing timestamps (>60min gaps)
- No links to related docs
- Abandoned sessions (no handoff)
- Inconsistent tags

✅ **Solution:** [doc/README-QUALITY.md#common-pitfalls](doc/README-QUALITY.md#common-pitfalls)

## Decision Framework

When managing RunNotes, agents MUST always ask:

### 1. Is This Work in the Correct Phase?

Research? Planning? Implementation? Review? Debug? Hotfix?

**If wrong phase:** Transition to correct phase, import relevant context

### 2. Has Sufficient Context Been Captured?

Can future developer understand **why**? Assumptions explicit? Alternatives documented? Trade-offs explained? Sources cited? Related docs linked?

**If insufficient:** Ask clarifying questions, request detail, prompt for assumptions

### 3. Are Phase Transition Criteria Met?

Review checklist for current phase. Verify all items completed. Document incomplete items.

**If not met:** Don't transition, identify gaps, plan to complete

### 4. What Patterns Are Emerging?

Search similar past sessions. Compare estimates vs actuals. Identify blockers. Note successful patterns.

**Extract and apply:** Improve estimates, avoid pitfalls, reuse approaches

### 5. Which Decisions Need Elevation to ADRs?

Architecturally significant? Technology adoption? Pattern establishment? Expensive to reverse? Multi-component impact?

**When identified:** Flag as ADR candidate, document in RunNotes, recommend formal ADR

### 6. Is Learning Value Being Maximized?

Failures documented? Hypotheses captured? Time tracked? Root causes identified? Salvageable components noted? Preventions documented?

**If underutilized:** Prompt for failure docs, ask about hypotheses, dig for root causes

## Agent Responsibilities

When working with RunNotes, AI agents MUST:

### 1. Prompt for Updates Every 30-60 Minutes

During implementation: "It's been [X] minutes since last RunNotes update. Let's log current progress."

Capture: current activity, state, time, progress, next steps

### 2. Validate Phase Transition Criteria Before Advancing

Review transition criteria checklist. Ask user to confirm criteria met. Don't advance if not met.

### 3. Extract Patterns from Historical RunNotes

When starting new work: Search for similar past sessions. Extract learnings. Apply patterns (time estimates, approaches, blockers).

### 4. Identify ADR Candidates

During research and planning: Watch for architecturally significant decisions. Flag as ADR candidates. Recommend creating ADRs.

### 5. Ensure Complete Context Capture

In every session: Link related RunNotes, ADRs, requirements. Document assumptions. Include file paths with line numbers. Explain "why" not just "what".

### 6. Link Related Documentation Obsessively

Maintain bidirectional links: RunNotes ↔ RunNotes, RunNotes ↔ ADRs, RunNotes ↔ Requirements, RunNotes → Code, RunNotes → Tests

**Never create isolated documentation.**
