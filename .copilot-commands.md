# RunNotes Quick Commands for Copilot CLI

This is a condensed command reference optimized for GitHub Copilot CLI integration.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize RunNotes in a project
runnote-init

# Start a new session
runnote-launch <phase> <topic>

# Find related work
runnote-search <query>
```

## Common Workflows

### Starting Work

```bash
# Research phase - investigating a problem
runnote-launch research "AuthenticationSystem"

# Planning phase - designing solution
runnote-launch planning "APIRefactor" --tags api,architecture

# Implementation - building the feature
runnote-launch implementation "UserProfile" --tags feature,backend

# Debug - investigating a bug
runnote-launch debug "LoginFailure" --tags authentication,bug
```

### Finding Context

```bash
# Search by tag
runnote-search tag :authentication
runnote-search tag :api

# Search by content
runnote-search text "performance"
runnote-search text "database migration"

# Search by phase
runnote-search phase implementation
runnote-search phase research

# Search by state (active/blocked/complete)
runnote-search state active

# Get summary of all RunNotes
runnote-search summary

# List all available tags
runnote-search list-tags
```

### Phase Transitions

```bash
# Validate current session is ready to transition
runnote-validate

# Transition to next phase
runnote-transition planning    # Research → Planning
runnote-transition implementation  # Planning → Implementation
runnote-transition review      # Implementation → Review
```

### Output Formats

```bash
# Default human-readable output
runnote-search tag :api

# Detailed output
runnote-search tag :api --format detailed

# JSON output (for scripting/parsing)
runnote-search tag :api --format json
runnote-search summary --format json
```

## Decision Tree for Copilot CLI

Use this to decide which command to run:

| User Intent | Command |
|-------------|---------|
| "Start debugging X" | `runnote-launch debug "X"` |
| "Plan feature Y" | `runnote-launch planning "Y"` |
| "Research Z" | `runnote-launch research "Z"` |
| "Find auth work" | `runnote-search tag :authentication` |
| "Find similar to X" | `runnote-search text "X"` |
| "What's active?" | `runnote-search state active` |
| "Ready to implement?" | `runnote-validate` |
| "Move to next phase" | `runnote-transition <next-phase>` |

## Phases Reference

| Phase | Use When | Typical Duration |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| `research` | Investigating problem, gathering requirements | 1-4 hours |
| `planning` | Designing solution, evaluating approaches | 1-3 hours |
| `implementation` | Building the solution | Hours to days |
| `review` | Retrospective, extracting learnings | 30-60 minutes |
| `debug` | Investigating bugs systematically | 30 min - 4 hours |
| `hotfix` | Urgent production fixes | 30 min - 2 hours |
| `performance` | Performance analysis & optimization | 2-8 hours |

## Tags Quick Reference

Common tag categories:

```bash
# By component
:frontend :backend :database :api :ui

# By type
:feature :bugfix :refactor :debt :spike

# By domain
:authentication :authorization :payment :notification

# By technology
:clojure :python :react :postgres :redis
```

## File Locations

```bash
# Project RunNotes directory
./runnote/

# Project configuration
./.runnote.edn

# Global configuration
~/.runnote/config.edn

# Templates
~/.runnote/template/

# Tools
~/.runnote/bin/
```

## Integration Patterns

### With ADR (Architecture Decision Records)

```bash
# Search ADRs when planning
adr-search content "authentication"

# Link ADRs in RunNotes metadata
{:related-documents {:adr #{"ADR-00042"}}}
```

### With Code

```bash
# Reference code in RunNotes
{:related-documents 
 {:code-files #{"src/auth/middleware.py:45-67"}}}
```

### With Tests

```bash
# Link test files
{:related-documents
 {:test-files #{"test/auth/test_middleware.py:12"}}}
```

## Quick Tips for Copilot CLI

1. **Always search before starting** - Avoid duplicate work:

   ```bash
   runnote-search text "your topic" && runnote-launch research "YourTopic"
   ```

2. **Chain commands for efficiency**:

   ```bash
   runnote-search state active && runnote-validate
   ```

3. **Use JSON for parsing**:

   ```bash
   runnote-search summary --format json | jq '.sessions[] | select(.status == "active")'
   ```

4. **Find active work quickly**:

   ```bash
   runnote-search state active --format detailed
   ```

5. **Check what needs review**:

   ```bash
   runnote-search phase implementation --format detailed
   ```

## State Indicators

When viewing RunNotes, watch for these indicators:

- 🟢 **Active** - Making progress as planned
- 🟡 **Investigating** - Researching unexpected issue  
- 🔴 **Blocked** - Cannot proceed, external dependency

## Update Frequency Guidelines

| Phase | Update Frequency |
|-------|------------------|
| Research | Every major finding (1-2 hours) |
| Planning | Each alternative evaluated (~1 hour) |
| Implementation | Every 30-60 minutes |
| Review | Once at end |
| Debug | Each hypothesis tested (30-60 min) |

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Start New Feature

```bash
# 1. Search for related work
runnote-search text "similar feature"

# 2. Start research phase
runnote-launch research "NewFeature" --tags feature,backend

# 3. After research, move to planning
runnote-transition planning

# 4. After planning, start implementation
runnote-transition implementation
```

### Pattern: Debug Production Issue

```bash
# 1. Start debug session immediately
runnote-launch debug "ProductionError" --tags hotfix,critical

# 2. Document investigation in real-time
# (Update session file with findings)

# 3. Move to review after fix
runnote-transition review
```

### Pattern: Find Historical Context

```bash
# 1. Search by topic
runnote-search text "authentication refactor"

# 2. Search by tag
runnote-search tag :authentication

# 3. Get detailed view
runnote-search tag :authentication --format detailed
```

## Exit Codes

All tools return standard exit codes:

- `0` - Success
- `1` - Invalid input/arguments
- `2` - Not found (file, session, etc.)
- `3` - Validation failed
